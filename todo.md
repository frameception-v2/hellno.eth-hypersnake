Here's the prioritized implementation checklist:

```markdown
### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 TS project with `/app` directory (Project Setup) - User gets base project structure
- [x] Create cyberpunk-themed layout.tsx with CSS Grid (Layout) - User sees primary #00ff88 theme
- [x] Configure Farcaster Frame SDK with metadata types (FrameConfig) - Enables frame compatibility
- [ ] Implement dynamic viewport meta tags in _document.tsx (Document) - Mobile-responsive viewport
- [x] Create GameCanvas component with ResizeObserver (Canvas) - Responsive canvas element
- [ ] Set up WebGL2/2D context with double buffering (Canvas) - Smooth rendering foundation
- [ ] Create game state reducer with TypeScript types (GameState) - Central state management
- [ ] Implement Immer-powered immutable updates (GameState) - Safe state mutations
- [ ] Add local storage integration for high scores (Persistence) - Saved scores between sessions

### Core Gameplay
- [ ] Create velocity-based update loop (MovementSystem) - 60fps movement foundation
- [ ] Implement direction queue with input buffering (InputSystem) - Responsive controls
- [ ] Set up collision detection Web Worker (Physics) - Off-thread collision checks
- [ ] Create snake segment growth mechanics (SnakeLogic) - Core gameplay progression
- [ ] Implement WebGL glow effects (Rendering) - Visual polish for snake body
- [ ] Add animated food particles (Rendering) - Clear food visualization
- [ ] Integrate Hammer.js swipe detection (TouchInput) - Mobile swipe controls
- [ ] Create virtual D-pad overlay (TouchUI) - Mobile-friendly control option

### Farcaster Integration
- [ ] Implement dynamic Frame metadata (FrameMeta) - Frame-responsive layout
- [ ] Add shareable state URL encoding (Sharing) - Game state persistence in links
- [ ] Create score screenshot with html2canvas (Social) - Shareable game moments
- [ ] Implement achievement toast system (Notifications) - Player feedback

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Add touch-action: manipulation CSS (MobileCSS) - Prevent browser zoom
- [ ] Implement orientation change handlers (Responsive) - Landscape/portrait support
- [ ] Create GPU-accelerated particle system (Performance) - Smooth mobile rendering
- [ ] Add frame rate limiter (Performance) - Consistent mobile experience

### Final Polish
- [ ] Implement game over state transitions (Flow) - Clear win/lose states
- [ ] Add speed multiplier HUD element (UI) - Visual speed feedback
- [ ] Create loading screen with progress (UX) - Perceived performance
- [ ] Integrate analytics events (Telemetry) - Usage tracking

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Add WebGL shader effects (Graphics) - Optional visual upgrade
- [ ] Implement daily challenge system (GameModes) - Replay incentive
```

Implementation Order:
1. Complete all Core Infrastructure tasks first
2. Build Core Gameplay systems in listed sequence
3. Implement Farcaster integration after gameplay works
4. Add mobile optimizations before final polish
5. Complete post-launch features after initial release

Each task includes affected component in parentheses and describes user-facing outcome. Dependencies flow vertically - higher tasks must be completed before lower ones in each section.
